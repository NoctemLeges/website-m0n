            <strong style="color:red;"> GLOBAL WARMING INCREASES THE LENGTH OF DAY:- </strong>HEAR ME OUT,BITCHES.THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM OF A BODY IS CONSERVED AS LONG AS THEERE IS NO EXTERNAL TORQUE APPLIED.NOW, ANGULAR MOMENTUM IS THE PRODUCT OF MOMENT OF INERTIA ABOUT THE AXIS OF ROTATION AND THE ANGULAR VELOCITY. HENCE, THE MELTING OF ICE CAPS INCREASES THE MOMENT OF INERTIA ABOUT THE EQUATOR, BUT THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM HAS TO BE CONSERVED. THUS, THE ANGULAR VELOCITY OF THE EARTH DECREASES AND WE GET LONGER DAYS,MOFOS XD.

            <strong style="color:red;"> THE ORIGINS OF THE WORD 'PENGUIN':- </strong>WELL, BITCHES, THIS WAS AN UNCONVENTIONAL FIND FOR ME. I WAS WATCHING A YOUTUBE VIDEO BY THIS FUNNY GUY, WHO MENTIONED THAT THE WOD FOR 'PENGUIN' IN MANDARIN CONSISTS OF THE CHARACTERS OF 'BUSINESSS' AND 'GOOSE', WHICH IS REALLY FUCKING HILARIOUS, IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF. LIKE IMAGINE A GOOSE IN A PENGUIN SUIT GOING "TODAY IS MY LUCKY DAY. I FEEL LIKE I'LL FINALLY GET THAT TRANSFER TO THE ARCTIC" XD.
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong style="color:red;"> ORIGINS OF THE NAME 'PYTHON' FOR THE LANGUAGE:- </strong>THIS ONE IS NOT THAT BIG. THE LANGUAGE IS NOT NAMED AFTER THE SNAKE, BUT AFTER THE SHOW MONTY PYTHON, WHICH THE DEVELOPER OF PYTHON LIKED TO WATCH XD.
